# Dwolla Integrations OAuth Flow Demo
A partner integration allows a Dwolla API Client to authenticate with Dwolla and authorize a third party application to interact with data stored in Dwolla via the application's user interface. With this authorization, you have the ability to create or view resources, or even receive webhooks.

Dwolla uses OpenID Connect which is a layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol to facilitate this authorization. The OpenID Connect flow is designed for web applications which leverages a browser-based interaction for user authentication.

### Installation and Setup
Use the package manager `npm` to install the required dependencies.

`npm install`

You will need to have a Dwolla Partner account to retrieve your Dwolla Key and Secret. [Sign up for a Dwolla Partner account](https://accounts.dwolla.com/sign-up/partner) and verify your email address. Once completed, navigate to the [`applications`](https://accounts.dwolla.com/login/partner) tab within the Partner Portal to create a test integration and retrieve your API Key/Secret.

### Request Authorization
Dwolla API Clients will need to accept authorization from your Integration in order for your integration to be able to read, write, or transact. Access tokens are short lived, and are only valid for one hour.

You will now want to add your clientId, clientSecret, and redirectURI to the project, being sure to url-encode all query strings.

To start the OpenID flow, construct the initiation URL which the user will visit in order to grant permission to your application. It describes who the Integration Application is (client_id), and where the user should be redirected to after they grant or deny permissions to your application (redirect_uri).

#### Example URL Format
https://accounts-sandbox.dwolla.com/auth?client_id=<clientId>&redirect_uri=<redirectUri>&response_type=code

For more information on these querystring parameters, visit our [developer docs](https://developers.dwolla.com/integrations/authorization#build-an-integration).

### Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the application.
You will then be able to access it at localhost:9000/auth.

#### Request Authorization from API Client
The Dwolla Client will authenticate with their Dwolla Account.

Grant Authorization to partner integration application.
The user (Dwolla Client) will be prompted to grant or deny access to a set of permissions requested by your application

#### Next Steps
After receiving this authorization code, you can now exchange it for an access token and refresh token pair. Check out our docs to learn more on these next steps.
